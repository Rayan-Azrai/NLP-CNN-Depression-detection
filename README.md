# Depression Detection using CNN

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect signs of depression in user-generated text. It combines multiple datasets from Kaggle, which have been preprocessed and merged for effective training.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `Depression detection CNN.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- The dataset used was compiled from multiple publicly available sources on Kaggle.

## ðŸ’¡ Highlights

- Preprocessing steps that are done and not included in this project include emoji and noise removal, lowercasing, and tokenization.
- Model built using TensorFlow/Keras with embedding layers and 1D convolutions.
- Achieves strong performance on large-scale, multi-source text data.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The datasets were sourced from Kaggle and combined. Due to the large size (~500,000 entries), the dataset is not included in this repo.
